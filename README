TimeWasters is a bash script that allows you to block a set of domains 
system-wide on your Mac. 

It will work on any Linux system, though there are Growl notifications 
included that use AppleScript, and will likely throw errors if not on a Mac. 

TimeWasters uses a config file found in /etc/timewasters.conf. This file 
contains a list of domains that will routed to localhost when blocked.

TimeWasters takes the list of domains found in the config-file and installs
them into /etc/hosts where it points them to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Since 
/etc/hosts overrides DNS on a Linux (or FreeBSD) system, this has the effect
of blocking the domain from your system. 

Note that this is not fool-proof, as some apps bypass system DNS alltogether, 
which is disgusting (IMHO). One such example is Tumblr. 

Since this is a domain-level blocking, it is far more useful than any browser
plugin. With a browser plugin, you can get around it simply by using a different
browser. Install a browser plugin in Firefox, and it has no effect in Chrome. 
TimeWasters affects *all* applications. If you block google.com, gmail will 
stop, maps will stop, Google docs will stop, and anything else that uses 
the google.com domain will stop working, regardless of the application used.

Note that timewasters will work from Cron, but since it needs sudo, you'll be 
tempted to put it into root's cron. It will work fine, except the growl 
notification will not show on your screen when it runs.

To install timewasters so that it works as a sytem command, run the following 
command from the directory where you downloaded these scripts: 

sudo ./install.sh

This will put the main files into /usr/local/bin/ and the config file in /etc/
